# Github Icon Replacer

A simple chrome extension that replaces the scary red ❌ in github reviews with the 🙏 icon instead. With the goal of encouraging people to request code changes but changing the tone from a slap in a face into a request for improvements.

This plugin is extremely primitive and I welcome any additions that you might be able to add to it. It is likely to break if github changes anything about it's class names or DOM structure.
